# What it does
evaluated 5 different classification algorithms based on their Precision, Accuracy, Runtime on 5 datasets (all 5 algorithms on each dataset). 

#Report
to see which datasets and classifiers were used.
to visualize the comparison and to finally determine which algorithm would be suitable for which dataset based on the evaluation metrics.
